Core Thinking

1. **Purpose**: The Prototype Design Pattern allows the creation of new objects by copying existing ones (cloning), which is efficient for creating similar avatars with slight variations.

2. **Modularity**: Each class serves a specific function, promoting separation of concerns and making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

3. **Flexibility**: Using a factory to manage avatar creation allows for easy modifications, such as adding new avatar types without altering existing code.

4. **Customization**: Users can modify cloned avatars (appearance, personality, skill) without affecting the original prototypes, enhancing user experience.
