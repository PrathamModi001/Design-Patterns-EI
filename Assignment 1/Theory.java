// Behavioral Patterns

// Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable
// Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, letting you parameterize clients with different requests

// Creational Patterns

// Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
// Prototype: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype

// Structural Patterns

// Decorator: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically
// Proxy: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it
