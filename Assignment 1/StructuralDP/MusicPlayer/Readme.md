Core Thinking for Music Player Application

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Implements the Adapter Pattern to allow the AudioPlayer to play different audio formats (MP3, VLC, MP4).

2. **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct classes for media players (AudioPlayer, VlcPlayer, Mp4Player) and an adapter (MediaAdapter) handle specific functionalities.

3. **Interface Use**: The MediaPlayer interface defines a unified method for playing audio files, promoting a clean and consistent API.

4. **Facade Design**: The AudioPlayerFacade simplifies interaction with the media player, hiding the complexities of audio format handling from the client.

5. **Extensibility**: New audio formats can be easily integrated by creating additional classes and updating the MediaAdapter, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

This design promotes flexibility and maintainability while effectively managing various audio formats in the music player application.
