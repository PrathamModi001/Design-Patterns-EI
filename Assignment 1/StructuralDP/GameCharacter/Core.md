Core Thinking for Game Character Application

1. **Bridge Pattern**: Implements the Bridge Pattern to decouple character types from their abilities, allowing flexible combinations.

2. **Abstraction and Implementation**: The Character class serves as an abstraction, while the Ability interface acts as the implementation. This allows characters to use various abilities without being tightly coupled.

3. **Character Types**: Concrete character classes (Warrior, Mage) extend the Character abstraction, each implementing their unique behavior.

4. **Ability Types**: Concrete ability classes (Fireball, Healing) implement the Ability interface, providing specific functionality that can be executed by characters.

5. **Dynamic Combinations**: The design allows for dynamic combinations of characters and abilities, enabling various gameplay scenarios (e.g., a Warrior using a Healing ability).

This design promotes a flexible and maintainable approach to character and ability management in a game setting.
