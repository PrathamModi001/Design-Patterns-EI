Core Thinking for Crop Rotation Application

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Implements the Strategy Pattern to allow dynamic switching between different crop rotation strategies (Wheat and Rice).

2. **Decoupling Behavior**: The CropRotationStrategy interface defines the behavior for crop rotation, decoupling the implementation from the context.

3. **Concrete Strategies**: Separate classes (WheatRotation, RiceRotation) implement the strategy interface, providing specific crop rotation sequences.

4. **Flexible Context**: The CropRotationContext class maintains a reference to the strategy and allows changing it at runtime, demonstrating adaptability.

5. **Easy Expansion**: Additional crop rotation strategies can be easily added without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

6. **Best Practices**: Maintains a clear and organized structure, with minimal comments focused on explaining the core functionality.

This design promotes flexibility and scalability, allowing for future expansion of crop rotation strategies as agricultural practices evolve.
